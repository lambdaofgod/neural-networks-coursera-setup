# Notes

## Some gotchas

### Week 8

Make sure to read Generating Text with Recurrent Neural Networks paper. It's more mathematically clear than the explanation from slides (and it's actually linked in course materials).

BTW the [demo](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ilya/rnn.html) of MRNN is available on Sutskever's page.

### Week 13
At the time when these notes were taken, week 13 quiz touched Sigmoid Belief Networks, for which video was deleted (video 13c). If you're unsure about the definition of P(h) for nodes without parents, then P(h=1)=P(h=0)=1/2 (this is consistent with the definition that is given, but not explicit and obvious).
